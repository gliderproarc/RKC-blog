## Just in case Netlify starts charging me {#just-in-case-netlify-starts-charging-me}

It's been a while since I've written on this blog. Lots has happened in the
interim and I feel like it's time to get back into the habit of sharing what I
have been learning. One of the things I learned was that Netlify will charge
accounts if they exceed the free usage tier. Fair enough, that's what's in their
EULA, so I need to be ready to pay, or move the blog.

GitHub Pages seems like the simple alternative, so let's see if I can get this
working. Let's see how it goes. ...yeah there we go.


## So ChatGPT happened {#so-chatgpt-happened}

If you are reading this in 2024, you are probably well aware of the hype and
talk surrounding tools like ChatGPT, and it's been fascinating seeing where
things have gone in that spare over the past year. November 2022 was when
ChatGPT launched, and I started using GPT4 in March or so of 2023. Now that I
have been using it for over a year, I have some ideas of what tools like this
will mean for how I compute moving forward.

LLMs aren't quite good enough at code to let me never have to write code again.
But I can say that it's really good at boiler plate code, and it's made writing
small GAS scripts for work super fast. In the coming years, I don't doubt that
it will be able to code better than I can. And I'm okay with that. I came to
coding as a way to do more with computers. If I can get an AI to write the code
for me, I'm not opposed to that. But for the time being, I'm still needed in the
loop to get stuff working. But if learning to be a Python master isn't a goal
anymore... what SHOULD I be learning next?


## How do you "learn" data? {#how-do-you-learn-data}

If data is what makes LLMs work, then it seems to me that I need to learn about
data. Pyhton is already the language of data science, and while I might be a
little late to the game to do the work of a data scientist, I can't imagine a
job I could have in the future that won't require working with data. So if
that's the case, might as well get a head start.


## Now I wish I had studied statistics in high-school {#now-i-wish-i-had-studied-statistics-in-high-school}

I didn't think it was an interesting area of math back then, but as I am going
through lectures online about statistics, it's not too bad. And if this how I
learn to work better with LLMs, so be it. Because even something like moving
this blog over from one service provider to another was made so much easier by
working with ChatGPT. I can imagine a world where most of the things I do on a
computer are made easier by working with an LLM. And if most of my day to day
work is done on a computer, LLMs should be a part of how I learn about doing my
work better.
