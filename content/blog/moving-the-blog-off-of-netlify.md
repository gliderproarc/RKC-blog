## Just in case Netlify starts charging me {#just-in-case-netlify-starts-charging-me}

It's been a while since I've written on this blog. Lots has happened in the
interim and I feel like it's time to get back into the habit of sharing what I
have been learning. One of the things I learned was that Netlify will charge
accounts if they exceed the free usage teir. Fair enough, that's what's in their
EULA, so I need to be ready to pay, or move the blog.

GitHub Pages seems like the simple alternative, so let's see if I can get this
working. Let's see how it goes.
