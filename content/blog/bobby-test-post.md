This is the first of many posts to come. I had never considered my self a
blogger type, but I have been learning some things recently and I feel like a
blog is a great way to share what I have been learning in an ...oddly
old fashioned manner. This past year I went from using Google docs to keep
notes at work, to today finding myself unwilling to use anything less than
Emacs and Org mode for a surprising amount of my day to day note taking and
organization. It was a lot to learn, but the journey was worth it, and I hope
to share not just what I have been learning about this past year (2020 was
one for the record books in more ways than one), but I haven't really felt
like I had a place to tell my story until now.

These days all the young kids in Japan want to grow up and be a YouTuber.
YouTube is a fascinating medium, and the amount of things you can learn and
see there is staggering. But I have found myself gravitating to text these
days and hope that a simple presentation can provide some counterpoint to the
rest of the world that seems to be happily consuming ever increasing amounts
of loud, noisy, colorful, and occasionally obnoxious video content in various
forms.

...wow, I started off this blog with a little "get off my lawn" soap-box
speech. This is going to be interesting.
