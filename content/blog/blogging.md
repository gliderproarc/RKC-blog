## Yeah I know... a blog post about blogging is kind of redundant {#yeah-i-know-dot-dot-dot-a-blog-post-about-blogging-is-kind-of-redundant}

...but I do have something I feel like stands to be said again on the internet
before someone forgets it again, or just in case someone hasn't heard it yet.
There is gentleman by the name of Scott Hanselman who said a bunch of very interesting
things is more than a few blog posts and a few youtube videos but one of his
stories really stuck with me.
I'll paraphrase what I remember from one of his talks: "If you are are going to
give someone the **gift** of your keystrokes, don't send it in an email. Put is
ANYTWHERE but an email. That person you emailed will read your message once and
the information will forever be trapped on a mail server somewhere. Much better
you put it somewhere online where someone else someday may find it. As long as
one more person reads your words, two people for the benefit of what you typed,
and your have doubled the effectiveness of your keystrokes."


## A cool idea, and a huge motivation for this blog {#a-cool-idea-and-a-huge-motivation-for-this-blog}

I can imagine one day someone may go looking on the interwebs for what I went
searching for about a year and a half ago. I wish I had found a blog like the
one I am writing now. I wish someone had told me Emacs and Org-mode was going to
revolutionize how I work with computers and plain-text. So I am writing my
thoughts on how I got here in the hope that one day someone if going to find this
and have a slightly easier time finding their way than I did.

If you are looking to get into a text editor and a markdown language that feels
like "taking the red pill", consider giving Emacs and Org-mode a try. They are
hard complicated tools, but they are so worth it. If you are a musician and you
like the extensibility of software and want to manipulate data streams to make
music, please check our MaxMSP, or at least Pure Data. And if you are typing on
a laptop right now, please give a mechanical keyboard a shot one day. I don't
think any of those are the perfect fit for everyone, but I would never go back
to the way I did things before I found these tools.

And consider putting your words out there for people to see. It's 2021 as of the
writing of this post, and all the young kids want to be YouTubers. Nothing
against youtube, but I can only imagine how long Google will keep all those
videos up on their servers. But internet archives and plain text? I expect that
information to be around for ages to come. It might take some digging to find
what you said, but it's worth it if you can give the gift of your keystrokes to
as many people as you can.
