Along with my search for an extensible note taking application and
discovering Emacs and Org-mode, I also discovered Spacemacs (a set of
configurations and settings for Emacs).

I didn't know what Vim was before I started reading the introduction in this
page. And that got me reading all kind of interesting articles on Vim, and
how it's nice to know if you need to SSH into a sever you don't know and
can't install any software. "vi" is going to be on that server, and it can
run in a terminal session without any GUI. Modal text editing is not
something I can used before, but having used several music synthesizers
interfaces that have several function layers, I found the ideas of modes and
functions for keys to be really easy to work with. When I installed Emacs and
started playing with it, I didn't mind the use of "hjkl" for navigation.

What I did find really confusing was vanilla Emacs and it's keybinding. I am
slowly getting used to them now, and having something like Spacemacs
probably slowed my progress when it came to learning Emacs it's self. But
Spacemacs made Emacs really approachable with a lot of help along the way. I
would definitely recommend Spacemacs to anyone looking to get into on of the
deep text editors but doesn't feel they can handle vanilla Emacs right away.

I found an article online that talked about not trying to pile more than one
"learning curve" onto of another. If you don't know how to run a terminal and
are trying to get into terminal Emacs, you have two unfamiliar things you are
trying to learn at the same time. By only tackling them one at a time, you
get to deal with each problem one at a time.

In my case I was trying to juggle the following:

-   Widows
-   WSL (Windows subsystem for linux)
-   Building Emacs from source
-   Emacs
-   Org-mode

    It was a bit of a mess at first, and I can smile now as I think of all the
    things I had to go though to get it all working. When I was trying to get
    it set up there were a lot of issues that plagued just WSL, but now there
    are many guides you can find online to help you get started like this one:

    WSL was a great option for getting Emacs installed an running, but it
    created a lot of issues got me really confused about what was what. Emacs
    can run terminal emulators inside it... so if I can't run a program is it
    because it is only in Emacs? What is Python environment? What is a virtual
    environment? Why are some environment variables different in Emacs verses
    a bash shell? I had a lot of things to learn and one could argue that I
    took the hard way.

    ...but it was worth it. If you are at all interested in trying out Org mode
    and don't know if you can handle Emacs without help, I would heartily
    suggest you give Spacemacs a try. Personally I am looking to move to Doom
    in the next few weeks. Doom is like Spacemacs in that it is a pre-made
    configuration, but it's crazy fast, and while not as user friendly as
    Spacemacs, I think I can learn to work with it now.

    As I make the transition to Doom, I will be sure to post my thoughts and
    impressions here on this blog. One more resource on Emacs and Spacemacs
    before I wrap this post up:

    Spacemacs: Installation, Configuration, and Navigation Tutorial

    This tutorial really got me set up and going. If there is one thing that
    struck me with Spacemacs, it was how nice and welcoming and helpful people
    were in helping me get up and going.
