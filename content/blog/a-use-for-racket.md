## Still writing some Racket {#still-writing-some-racket}

I was looking back over what I have learned over the past few years since
starting to learn how to program and I think I have started to see a pattern.
I'm not particularly good at figuring out what to make. If anything, I like more
the challenge of making a thing work, but having some kind of end goal; a thing
I want to make is still something I struggle with. I much prefer the challenge
of trying to express the idea of computation in a certain way, rather then
actually trying to do something with it when it's done.

So I am kind of glad I am back to writing more Python. Because of the languages
I have used to actually get things done, I think I have found the most practical
use for Python. So where does Racket fall in all this?


## A languages "laboratory" {#a-languages-laboratory}

Python and Elixir are cool. I like writing them just fine. But occasionally I
find myself reading about something and wondering "Hey, can I do that in Python
or Elixir?". And sometimes I can, sometimes I can't. Both Python and Elixir have
some language contracts for working with Lazy evaluation, but nothing like what
Racket has in the "Lazy" version of the language you can use or import at a
library. And since I don't have any projects I want to make in Racket, I don't
have to worry so much about the rest of the ecosystem. I can just use it to play
with features of programming languages.

The more I write Elixir, the happier I am with how it fits how I think about
computing. It really seems to "fit" how I imagine you would want to think about
getting a computer to calculate things. Python is less straight forward, and
requires I do things the Python way, but it usually works and there are so many
libraries to support you and get things done. But neither language is
particularly good about letting you try things like mixing typed and un-typed
code.

Racket is a lisp, and is extremely flexible. Some would say to a fault. But if
you are looking for that flexibility, Racket is a very welcoming environment for
doing that kind of experimentation.


## I think it's time to make a Phoenix app {#i-think-it-s-time-to-make-a-phoenix-app}

I'm approaching the end of my Python textbook, and rather than making a flask
app or something of that sort, I think it's time I give Elixir's web framework a
shot. The closest I have come to making a website is thing blog, and it will be
interesting to see what it's like when I control everything on a website from
top to bottom.

Expect to see some blog posts detailing what it's like getting that started
soon. Hopefully.
